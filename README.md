# Micrograd - My Implementation

This is **my own implementation** of [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), a minimal autograd engine originally created by [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy).  
I built this project by following Andrej's YouTube video and GitHub repository, which **inspired me a lot** to understand how deep learning frameworks like PyTorch work internally.
